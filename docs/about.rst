TAPS is set of tools for pathway simulation highly inspired by Atomic Simulation
Environment (ASE). Hence, our principle shares it of ASE, namely
*easy to use*, *flexible* and *customizable*.

- **Easy to use**:
  Pathway simulation is mainly on the


- **Flexible**:
Purpose of TAPS is not limited only for atomic system, but rather user defined
model system. User can add


- **customizable**:
TAPS is mainly on the test of concept on small size problem. To use distributed
system, we encourage you to use julia project which is aim for computation
based dev project.
